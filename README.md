A Toit display driver for the hacked version of the Ikea Obegränsad LED panel.

See https://github.com/Drewbi/oberled-device/ for an example of this
hardware hack, putting an ESP32 in the panel.

This project has no association or affiliation with Ikea.

The driver is currently untested as I don't have the hardware.

Currenly no gray scale pixels supported.
